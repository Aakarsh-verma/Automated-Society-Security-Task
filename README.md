# Automated-Society-Security-Task

## Problem Statement
* Automation of Society Security Tasks â€“ Visitors in a housing society fall in the category of regular visitors lik edrivers, maids, milkman, sweeper, car cleaners, etc who visit on a daily basis and the other category is of infrequent known or unknown visitors ( like guests, delivery boys).
* Record with timestamp registered regular visitors and their temperature check.


## Problem Dimensions:
This problem has the following dimension
* First time registration of Regular visitors as described above.
* All subsequent visits, visitors data (facial recognition) should be captured using a continuous camera feed along with their body temperature also recorded in the solution.
* The facial recognition should take care of visual changes in appearance of a person say with or without beard/moustache, glasses, raincoat or even helmet.
* The solution should also present a end of day report.
* Temperature reading of the visitor also needs to be done. This can be done either with a separate device or a single device for camera and temperature both. However please note that an integrated solution should be presented with no manual intervention for either temperature / face recording.
